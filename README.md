# Creating a REST API to handle requests from the client (CIT281 Project)

By using different routes in the browser, this application handles requests from a user to search, edit, add, or delete the data below.

```
const data = [
  {
    question: "Q1",
    answer: "A1",
  },
  {
    question: "Q2",
    answer: "A2",
  },
  {
    question: "Q3",
    answer: "A3",
  },
];
```
